}
\arguments{
\item{x}{For \code{getDPCoA}, a numeric matrix of expression values
where rows are features and columns are cells.
Alternatively, a \code{TreeSummarizedExperiment} containing such a matrix.

For \code{addDPCoA} a \linkS4class{TreeSummarizedExperiment} containing the
expression values as well as a \code{rowTree} to calculate \code{y} using
\code{\link[ape:cophenetic.phylo]{cophenetic.phylo}}.}

\item{y}{a \code{dist} or a symmetric \code{matrix} compatible with
\code{ade4:dpcoa}}

\item{...}{Currently not used.}

\item{ncomponents}{Numeric scalar indicating the number of DPCoA dimensions
to obtain.}

\item{ntop}{Numeric scalar specifying the number of features with the highest
variances to use for dimensionality reduction. Alternatively \code{NULL},
if all features should be used. (default: \code{ntop = NULL})}

\item{subset_row}{Vector specifying the subset of features to use for
dimensionality reduction. This can be a character vector of row names, an
integer vector of row indices or a logical vector.}

\item{scale}{Logical scalar, should the expression values be standardized?}

\item{transposed}{Logical scalar, is x transposed with cells in rows?}

\item{assay.type}{a single \code{character} value for specifying which
assay to use for calculation.}

\item{assay_name}{a single \code{character} value for specifying which
assay to use for calculation.
(Please use \code{assay.type} instead. At some point \code{assay_name}
will be disabled.)}

\item{exprs_values}{a single \code{character} value for specifying which
assay to use for calculation.
(Please use \code{assay.type} instead.)}

\item{tree_name}{a single \code{character} value for specifying which
rowTree will be used in calculation.
(By default: \code{tree_name = "phylo"})}

\item{altexp}{String or integer scalar specifying an alternative experiment
containing the input data.}

\item{name}{String specifying the name to be used to store the result in the
reducedDims of the output.}
}
\value{
For \code{getDPCoA} a matrix with samples as rows and CCA dimensions as
columns

For \code{addDPCoA} a modified \code{x} with the results stored in
\code{reducedDim} as the given \code{name}
}
\description{
Double Principal Correspondance analysis is made available via the
\code{ade4} package in typical fashion. Results are stored in the
\code{reducedDims} and are available for all the expected functions.
}
\details{
In addition to the reduced dimension on the features, the reduced dimension
for samples are returned as well as \code{sample_red} attribute.
\code{eig}, \code{feature_weights} and \code{sample_weights} are
returned as attributes as well.
